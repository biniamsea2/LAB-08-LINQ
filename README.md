*Author: Biniam Tesfamariam*

## Description
This is a C# console application that brings in data from an 
external file, reads the data, and can filter the data based on specified values.


## Program Specifications  
###### Your solution should include the following:

- The data.json file to your solution at the root folder  
- Read in the file and answer the questions below  
- Each question and answer should be outputted to the console.  
## Questions

- Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list (Final Total: 147 neighborhoods)  
- Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names (Final Total: 143)  
- Remove the duplicates (Final Total: 39 neighborhoods)  
- Rewrite the queries from above and consolidate all into one single query.  
- Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ Query statements instead of LINQ method calls and vice versa.)
